Task Explanation
For this assignment, I developed a pixel-perfect clone of the Google Image Search Interface, replicating the Google Lens experience using React.js and CapacitorJS. The project includes three main pages: the Google App Homepage, the Google Lens Search Page, and the Google Lens Results Page. Key features include:
Homepage: A mobile-friendly layout with a search bar, voice input (using Web Speech API), sign-in sidebar, and mock feed.

Image Search: Camera and gallery access (via CapacitorJS), a crop tool (using react-image-crop), and navigation to the results page.

Results Page: Displays the uploaded image and mock related results in a responsive grid.

The UI is designed to match the Google Lens aesthetic (dark theme, minimal design) and is responsive across devices. The project highlights image processing (crop tool, related results display) and meets all assignment requirements.
